      <h1>Introduction to Widgets</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Flutter widgets are built using a modern framework that takes inspiration from React. The central idea is that
        you build your UI out of widgets. Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current
        configuration and state. When a widget’s state changes, the widget rebuilds its description, which the framework
        diffs against the previous description in order to determine the minimal changes needed in the underlying render
        tree to transition from one state to the next.

          <h1>Hello world</h1>
        </header>
        <p>The minimal Flutter app simply calls the runApp() function within a widget:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-dart">
            import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; 

            void main() {
                runApp(
                  Center(
                    child: Text(
                      'Hello, world!',
                      textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
                  ),
                ),
              );
            }
            </code></pre>
        <p>
          The runApp() function takes the given Widget and makes it the root of the widget tree. In this example,
          the widget tree consists of two widgets, the Center widget and its child, the Text widget. The framework
          forces the root widget to cover the screen, which means the text “Hello, world” ends up centered on
          screen. The text direction needs to be specified in this instance; when the MaterialApp widget is used,
          this is taken care of for you, as demonstrated later.
        </p>
        <p>
          When writing an app, you’ll commonly author new widgets that are subclasses of either StatelessWidget or
          StatefulWidget, depending on whether your widget manages any state. A widget’s main job is to implement
          a build function, which describes the widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets. The framework
          builds those widgets in turn until the process bottoms out in widgets that represent the underlying
          RenderObject, which computes and describes the geometry of the widget.

          <h1>Basic widgets</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Flutter comes with a suite of powerful basic widgets, of which the following are very commonly used:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text: The Text widget lets you create a run of styled text within your application.</li>
          <li>Row, Column: These flex widgets let you create flexible layouts in both the horizontal (Row)
            and vertical (Column) directions. Its design is based on the web’s flexbox layout model.</li>
          <li>Stack: Instead of being linearly oriented (either horizontally or vertically), a Stack widget
            lets you stack widgets on top of each other in paint order. You can then use the Positioned widget
            on children of a Stack to position them relative to the top, right, bottom, or left edge of the stack.
            Stacks are based on the web’s absolute positioning layout model.</li>
          <li>Container: The Container widget lets you create a rectangular visual element. A container can be
            decorated with a BoxDecoration, such as a background, a border, or a shadow. A Container can also have
            margins, padding, and constraints applied to its size. In addition, a Container can be transformed in
            three dimensional space using a matrix.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below are some simple widgets that combine these and other widgets:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-dart">
          import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

            class MyAppBar extends StatelessWidget {
              MyAppBar({this.title});
            
              // Fields in a Widget subclass are always marked "final".
            
              final Widget title;
            
              @override
              Widget build(BuildContext context) {
                return Container(
                  height: 56.0, // in logical pixels
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8.0),
                  decoration: BoxDecoration(color: Colors.blue[500]),
                  // Row is a horizontal, linear layout.
                  child: Row(
                    // <Widget> is the type of items in the list.
                    children: <Widget>[
                      IconButton(
                        icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
                        tooltip: 'Navigation menu',
                        onPressed: null, // null disables the button
                      ),
                      // Expanded expands its child to fill the available space.
                      Expanded(
                        child: title,
                      ),
                      IconButton(
                        icon: Icon(Icons.search),
                        tooltip: 'Search',
                        onPressed: null,
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              }
            }
            
            class MyScaffold extends StatelessWidget {
              @override
              Widget build(BuildContext context) {
                // Material is a conceptual piece of paper on which the UI appears.
                return Material(
                  // Column is a vertical, linear layout.
                  child: Column(
                    children: <Widget>[
                      MyAppBar(
                        title: Text(
                          'Example title',
                          style: Theme.of(context).primaryTextTheme.title,
                        ),
                      ),

                        ),

                );
              }
            }
            
            void main() {
              runApp(MaterialApp(
                title: 'My app', // used by the OS task switcher
                home: MyScaffold(),
              ));
            }</code></pre>
        <p>Be sure to have a uses-material-design: true entry in the flutter section of your pubspec.yaml file.
          It allows you to use the predefined set of Material icons.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-dart">
                name: my_app
                flutter:
                  uses-material-design: true</code></pre>
        <p>
          Many Material Design widgets need to be inside of a MaterialApp to display properly,
          in order to inherit theme data. Therefore, run the application with a MaterialApp.
        </p>
        <p>
          The MyAppBar widget creates a Container with a height of 56 device-independent pixels with an internal
          padding of 8 pixels,
          both on the left and the right. Inside the container, MyAppBar uses a Row layout to organize its children.
          The middle child, the title widget, is marked as Expanded,
          which means it expands to fill any remaining available space that hasn’t been consumed by the other
          children.
          You can have multiple Expanded children and determine the ratio in which they consume the available space
          using the
          flex argument to Expanded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The MyScaffold widget organizes its children in a vertical column. At the top of the column it places an
          instance of MyAppBar,
          passing the app bar a Text widget to use as its title. Passing widgets as arguments to other widgets is a
          powerful technique
          that lets you create generic widgets that can be reused in a wide variety of ways. Finally, MyScaffold uses an
          Expanded to fill
          the remaining space with its body, which consists of a centered message.

        </header>
        <p>
          Flutter provides a number of widgets that help you build apps that follow Material Design. A Material app
          starts with the MaterialApp widget, which builds a number of useful widgets at the root of your app, including
          a Navigator, which manages a stack of widgets identified by strings, also known as “routes”. The Navigator
          lets you transition smoothly between screens of your application. Using the MaterialApp widget is entirely
          optional but a good practice.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-dart">
            import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

            void main() {
              runApp(MaterialApp(
                title: 'Flutter Tutorial',
                home: TutorialHome(),
              ));
            }
            
            class TutorialHome extends StatelessWidget {
              @override
              Widget build(BuildContext context) {
                // Scaffold is a layout for the major Material Components.
                return Scaffold(
                  appBar: AppBar(
                    leading: IconButton(
                      icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
                      tooltip: 'Navigation menu',
                      onPressed: null,
                    ),
                    title: Text('Example title'),
                    actions: <Widget>[
                      IconButton(
                        icon: Icon(Icons.search),

                        onPressed: null,
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                  // body is the majority of the screen.
                  body: Center(
                    child: Text('Hello, world!'),
                  ),
                  floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
                    tooltip: 'Add', // used by assistive technologies
                    child: Icon(Icons.add),
                    onPressed: null,

                );

            }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Now that the code has switched from MyAppBar and MyScaffold to the AppBar and Scaffold widgets, and from
          material.dart, the app is starting to look at bit more Material. For example, the app bar has a shadow and
          the title text inherits the correct styling automatically. A floating action button is also added.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that widgets are passed as arguments to other widgets. The Scaffold widget takes a number of
          different widgets as named arguments, each of which are placed in the Scaffold layout in the appropriate
          place. Similarly, the AppBar widget lets us pass in widgets for the leading and the actions of the title
          widget. This pattern recurs throughout the framework and is something you might consider when designing
          your own widgets.

          <h1>Handling gestures</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Most applications include some form of user interaction with the system. The first step in building an
          interactive application is to detect input gestures. See how that works by creating a simple button:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-dart">
            class MyButton extends StatelessWidget {
              @override
              Widget build(BuildContext context) {
                return GestureDetector(
                  onTap: () {
                    print('MyButton was tapped!');
                  },
                  child: Container(
                    height: 36.0,
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                    margin: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8.0),
                    decoration: BoxDecoration(
                      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5.0),
                      color: Colors.lightGreen[500],
                    ),
                    child: Center(
                      child: Text('Engage'),
                    ),
                  ),
                );
              }
            }</code></pre>
        <p>
          The GestureDetector widget doesn’t have a visual representation but instead detects gestures made by the user.
          When the user taps the Container, the GestureDetector calls its onTap callback, in this case printing a
          message to the console. You can use GestureDetector to detect a variety of input gestures, including taps,
          drags, and scales.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many widgets use a GestureDetector to provide optional callbacks for other widgets. For example, the
          IconButton, RaisedButton, and FloatingActionButton widgets have onPressed() callbacks that are triggered when
          the user taps the widget.

          <h1>Changing widgets in response to input</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          So far, this page has used only stateless widgets. Stateless widgets receive arguments from their parent
          widget, which they store in final member variables. When a widget is asked to build, it uses these stored
          values to derive new arguments for the widgets it creates.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to build more complex experiences—for example, to react in more interesting ways to user
          input—applications typically carry some state. Flutter uses StatefulWidgets to capture this idea.
          StatefulWidgets are special widgets that know how to generate State objects, which are then used to hold
          state. Consider this basic example, using the RaisedButton mentioned earlier:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-dart">
            class Counter extends StatefulWidget {
              // This class is the configuration for the state. It holds the
              // values (in this case nothing) provided by the parent and used by the build
              // method of the State. Fields in a Widget subclass are always marked "final".
            
              @override
              _CounterState createState() => _CounterState();
            }
            
            class _CounterState extends State<Counter> {
              int _counter = 0;
            
              void _increment() {
                setState(() {
                  // This call to setState tells the Flutter framework that
                  // something has changed in this State, which causes it to rerun
                  // the build method below so that the display can reflect the
                  // updated values. If you change _counter without calling
                  // setState(), then the build method won't be called again,
                  // and so nothing would appear to happen.
                  _counter++;
                });
              }
            
              @override
              Widget build(BuildContext context) {
                // This method is rerun every time setState is called, for instance
                // as done by the _increment method above.
                // The Flutter framework has been optimized to make rerunning

        <p>
          You might wonder why StatefulWidget and State are separate objects. In Flutter, these two types of objects
          have different life cycles. Widgets are temporary objects, used to construct a presentation of the application
          in its current state. State objects, on the other hand, are persistent between calls to build(), allowing them
          to remember information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example above accepts user input and directly uses the result in its build method. In more complex
          applications, different parts of the widget hierarchy might be responsible for different concerns; for
          example, one widget might present a complex user interface with the goal of gathering specific information,
          such as a date or location, while another widget might use that information to change the overall
          presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Flutter, change notifications flow “up” the widget hierarchy by way of callbacks, while current state flows
          “down” to the stateless widgets that do presentation. The common parent that redirects this flow is the State.
          The following slightly more complex example shows how this works in practice:

        <p>
          Notice the creation of two new stateless widgets, cleanly separating the concerns of displaying the counter
          (CounterDisplay) and changing the counter (CounterIncrementor). Although the net result is the same as the
          previous example, the separation of responsibility allows greater complexity to be encapsulated in the
          individual widgets, while maintaining simplicity in the parent.
